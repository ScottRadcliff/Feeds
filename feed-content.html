<h1>Downtime last Saturday</h1><p>On Saturday, December 22nd we had a significant outage and we want to take 
the time to explain what happened. This was one of the worst outages in
the history of GitHub, and it's not at all acceptable to us. I'm very
sorry that it happened and our entire team is working hard to prevent 
similar problems in the future.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>We had a scheduled maintenance window Saturday morning to perform 
software updates on our aggregation switches. This software update was 
recommended by our network vendor and was expected to address the 
problems that we encountered in an 
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1346-network-problems-last-friday">earlier outage</a>. We 
had tested this upgrade on a number of similar devices without 
incident, so we had a good deal of confidence. Still, performing an 
update like this is always a risky proposition so we scheduled a 
maintenance window and had support personnel from our vendor 
on the phone during the upgrade in case of unforseen...<h1>Scheduled Maintenance Windows</h1><p>As our infrastructure continues to grow and evolve, it's sometimes 
necessary to perform system maintenance that may cause downtime. We 
have a number of projects queued up over the coming months to take 
our infrastructure to the next level, so we are announcing a scheduled
maintenance window on Saturday mornings beginning at 
<a href="http://everytimezone.com/#2012-12-22,60,6be">0500 Pacific</a>.</p>

<p>We do not intend to perform maintenance every Saturday, and even when we
do, most of them will not be disruptive to customers. We are using 
these windows only in cases where the tasks we're performing have a 
higher than normal level of risk of impacting the site.</p>

<p>We will always update our <a href="https://status.github.com/">status site</a> 
before we begin and again when we're done. In cases where we expect 
there to be more than a few minutes of disruption we will also make 
an announcement on the <a href="http://github.com/blog">GitHub Blog</a> by the 
preceding Frida...<h1>Sara Pyle is a GitHubber</h1><p>Sara Pyle is joining the ranks of the supportocats! She comes to us fresh from the world of Library Science (which continues to be a real thing), having worked in IT support for librarians, which is kind of like watching the watchmen.</p>

<p>She has the social savvy of Clay Shirky, surfs the world wide web, and has been an actual webmaster. In fact, she's basically like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLlj_GeKniA">Julia Stiles in that one episode of Ghostwriter</a>.</p>

<p>She can jam with console cowboys in cyberspace, has read Neuromancer, has experienced newscape, dreamscape, Netscape Navigator, AND cyberpunk. </p>

<p>When she's not rooting for the Oklahoma City Thunder or coddling a grumpy old cat, Sara bakes vegan things<sup>1</sup>, reads All The Books<sup>2</sup>, and hangs out with her husband and nieces.</p>

<p>She's fixin' to support y'all.</p>

Every day, our users commit code, open and close issues, and make plans for their software <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html">to take over the world</a>. We track all of this activity and make the public data available <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/">via our API</a>.</p>

<p>Over half a million individual events happen every day on GitHub. Here's a look into the ever-expanding Octoverse in 2012.</p>

There were over <a href="http://instagram.com/p/StOrjupDXf/">1337 forks</a> and almost 200 playable games at the end of the competition. Today, we're announcing the winners! </p>

<p>Our panel of expert judges played and rated every game; the five winning entries below received the highest overall marks. We would also like to recognize six runners up and seven honorable mentions. Not only are all these awesome games free and available now for anyone to play, the source code is all publicly available on GitHub. If you're inspired to learn about (or improve your skills with) game development, or even create your own game, just check out the repositories below.</p>

Supporting these types of uploads was a source of great confusion and pain – they were too similar to the files in a Git repository. As part of our ongoing effort to keep GitHub focused on building software, we are deprecating the Downloads Tab.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The ability to upload new files via the web site is disabled today.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing links to previously uploaded files will continue to work for the foreseeable future.</p></li>
<li><p>Repositories that already have uploads will continue to list their downloads for the next 90 days (tack on <code>/downloads</code> to the end of any repository to see them).</p></li>

<p>Today we're excited to share the next generation of <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>. Rewritten from scratch using <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/rugged">better libraries</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/styleguide">styleguide</a>, the new Gist is part of our plan to make sharing code easier than ever.</p>

We're pleased to introduce Julio Avalos, GitHub's first lawyer and counsel. In addition to all things legal, Julio loves music, reading, whiskey, and trying to figure out how to make legal practice more collaborative and less stuffy. In his free time, he hangs out with his family, tries to figure out how to apply Žižek to everyday life, watches reruns of any non-TOS Star Trek series, and is the host of <a href="http://chopradio.com/main.html">Choplogic Radio, an online radio show.</a> </p>
